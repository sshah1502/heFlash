# heFlash
This code detects stars undergoing core Helium Flash in the ZTF database.

Core Helium flash is an phenomenon that occurs in all the low-mass red giant stars due to which they descend from the tip of the RGB to the RC phase. Stars that are found in the RC phase have been found to have higher values of Lithium than the stars in the tip of the RGB. Helium flash is the process that is believed to be responsible for this.

heFlash python package obtains the 7 years of lightcurves of the low mass red giants from the Zwicky Transient Facility database and detects for Helium flash events. While we do not know how the event might look, in this version of the code, manual inspection is required.
